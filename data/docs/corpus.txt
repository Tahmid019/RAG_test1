A Letter to God

**By Gregorio López y Fuentes**

The house – the only one in the entire valley – sat on the crest of a low hill. It was during the meal that, as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. In the northeast, huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and sweet. The older boys were working in the field, while the smaller ones were playing near the house until Lencho's wife called to them all: "Come for dinner..."

It was during the meal that, as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. In the northeast, huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and sweet. The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body. And when he returned, he exclaimed: “These aren't raindrops falling from the sky; they are new coins. The big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones are fives...”

With a satisfied expression he regarded the sky, for it was during the meal that, as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. In the northeast, huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching.

It’s during the meal that, as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. In the northeast, huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching. It was during the meal that, as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. The air was fresh and sweet.

But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a single hope: help from God.

“It’s during the meal that, as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall.” The house—the only one in the entire valley—sat on the crest of a low hill. It was during the meal that, as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall.

With a satisfied expression he regarded the sky, for it was during the meal that, as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall.

But during the meal, as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. In the northeast, huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching.

And then it all turned.

It was during the meal that, as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. In the northeast, huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain came very large hailstones. Truly it seemed during the meal that, as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall.

It hailed for an hour on the house – the only one in the whole valley – and on the field – the whole valley – and the field was white, as if covered with salt. Not a leaf remained on the trees. The flowers were gone from the plants. The corn was totally destroyed. The beans were without a single pod.

The only thing the earth needed was a downpour or at least a shower and throughout the morning Lencho – who knew his fields intimately – had done nothing else but look at the sky.

“It’s during the meal,” he said, “that, as I had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall.”

The house – the only one in the entire valley – sat on the crest of a low hill. In the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a single hope: **help from God.**

"God: if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry during the coming year."

It was during the night that, as Lencho lay on his bed, he got an idea: **to write a letter to God**.

So, in the public square, at the post office, he wrote:

> **God: if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry during the coming year. I need a hundred pesos to sow my field again and to live until the crop comes, because the hailstorm… God: I hope you can help me. I know you will. —Lencho**

He placed the letter in an envelope, addressed it to “God” and went to town. At the post office, he put a stamp on the letter and dropped it into the mailbox.

One of the employees, who was a postman and also helped at the post office, laughed heartily at the idea of a letter addressed to God. He showed it to the postmaster, who also laughed, but then he turned serious and said: “What faith! I wish I had the faith of the man who wrote this letter. To believe so strongly, so purely… It's like a miracle.”

So, to not disillusion Lencho, the postmaster came up with an idea: **answer the letter**.

But when he opened the letter to read what Lencho had written, it was clear that **Lencho needed something more than goodwill and ink.** He needed **money**. The postmaster asked for donations from his employees and friends. He himself gave part of his salary, and in the end, **he managed to collect a little more than half** of what Lencho had asked for – **seventy pesos**.

He put the money in an envelope addressed to Lencho and with it a letter signed: **“God”**.

The following Sunday, Lencho came to ask if there was a letter for him.

The postman handed over the letter. Lencho was not surprised to see a letter from God – he had such faith! But when he opened it and counted the money, **his anger flared**. **It was not the full hundred pesos.**

Immediately, he went to the window, asked for paper and ink, and began to write a second letter. He finished, put it in the envelope, and walked up to the mailbox again.

The postmaster, curious, opened the letter once Lencho left.

This is what it said:

> **God: Of the money that I asked for, only seventy pesos reached me. Send me the rest, since I need it very much. But don’t send it through the post office, because the employees here are a bunch of crooks.**
> —Lencho
